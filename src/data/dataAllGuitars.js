This genuinely iconic electric guitar has had a rather large hand in shaping rock 'n' roll ever since it was released way back in 1952. Many of the biggest axe-wielding stars from Slash and Gary Moore to Billy Gibbons and Jimmy Page have opted to make this single-cut beauty their number one guitar and, as a result, have firmly cemented Les Paul's place in music history. \n" +

        "With the Les Paul being so popular for so long, it would stand to reason that there's a myriad of different options available. We know this can get a little confusing. That’s why we've put together this handy guide to the best Les Pauls you can buy right now, at various price points. We have also listed them in order of series, from the budget-friendly Epiphone to the high-end Murphy Labs custom shop model, to make it a little easier to navigate. ",

While the time-honored mahogany neck and body construction provides the foundation for a powerful tone, the not-too-strong \"Rounded\" neck profile promises comfortable playability in all rosewood fingerboard positions. With the Set's popular Gibson 490 humbucker, the SG Standard delivers powerful sound with a wide midrange range and the perfect dose of \"bite\" in a guitar amp favored by Blues and Rock. Last but not least, the Gibson SG Standard is equipped with Grover Rotomatic tuners and a classic pair of Tune-O-Matic bridge and stop bar shank.",

      "aboutGuitar" : "Ever since its debut at the tail end of the 50s, the ES-335 has wowed guitar players and gig-goers alike with its singing sustain and harmonically complex tone. Beloved by blues-loving, retro-tone chasers, as well as modern riff rock aficionados, the ES-335 delivers a bell-like chime that other guitars simply can’t replicate. There is one pretty sizeable downside, though – a Gibson will set you back a pretty penny! \n" +
        "Luckily, Gibson’s sibling brand has our back with the Inspired By Gibson Epiphone ES-335, which brings the effortless elegance of Gibson’s golden boy to the masses with this extremely affordable semi-hollow axe. \n" +
        "Sticking to the blueprints of the original, the Epiphone utilizes a layered maple top, back, and sides, while the solid maple tone block at its heart generates the crying sustain you’ve come to expect from this style of guitar. Despite its modest price tag, this Epiphone feels as solid as a rock, with our review example sitting right in the Goldilocks zone of not feeling too heavy or too light. ",
